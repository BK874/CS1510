To prove that if an algorithm for one of Undirected Graph Isomorphism, Directed Graph Isomorphism, and Mixed Graph Isomorphism implies that they all do, the following reductions need to be made:

\subsection*{Directed Graph Isomorphism $\leq_p$ Mixed Graph Isomorphism}
Assume there exists an algorithm for Mixed Graph Isomorphism called $MISO$. Then it is possible to construct a poly-time algorithm for Directed Graph Isomorphism called $DISO$ as follows:
\\\\
$DISO(G, H):$\\
\tab return $MISO(G, H)$
\\\\
A purely directed graph can be thought of as a special case of a mixed graph, so an algorithm for Mixed Graph Isomorphism works just as well on inputs that only have directed edges. Moreover, since $MISO$ is poly-time, and since $DISO$ makes no transformations from input to input or from output to output, then $DISO$ is also poly-time.

\subsection*{Undirected Graph Isomorphism $\leq_p$ Mixed Graph Isomorphism}
Assume there exists an algorithm for Mixed Graph Isomorphism called $MISO$. Then it is possible to construct a poly-time algorithm for Undirected Graph Isomorphism called $UISO$ as follows:
\\\\
$UISO(G, H):$\\
\tab return $MISO(G, H)$
\\\\
