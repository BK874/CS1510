A 3-COLOR algorithm makes a choice at every vertex $v_i$ either to color it red, green, or blue. We can model that in a Boolean formula as three variables $r_i$, $g_i$, $b_i$, such that only one of the three can be true. So in the formula $F$ there is a clause $(r_i \oplus g_i \oplus b_i)$, which in CNF is:
\begin{align*}
(\neg r_i \lor \neg g_i) &\land \\
(\neg g_i \lor \neg b_i) &\land \\
(\neg b_i \lor \neg r_i) &\land \\
(r_i \lor g_i \lor b_i) 
\end{align*}
Moreover, for each edge $(v_i, v_j) \in G$, it cannot be the case that they are the same color, which corresponds to the variables $r_i$ and $r_j$ not both being true, same with $g_i$ and $g_j$, and $b_i$ and $b_j$. So in the formula $F$ there is a clause $(\neg (r_i \land r_j)) \land \neg (g_i \land g_j) \land \neg (b_i \land b_j))$, which in CNF is:

\begin{align*}
(\neg r_i \lor \neg r_j) &\land \\
(\neg g_i \lor \neg g_j) &\land \\
(\neg b_i \lor \neg b_j)
\end{align*}

So an algorithm for 3-COLOR is:\\
3-COLORAlgorithm($G$):\\
\tab Let $F = \emptyset$ \\
\tab for each vertex $v_i \in G$: \\
\tab\tab $F = F \union$ (vertex CNF described above)
\\\\
\tab for each edge $(v_i, v_j) \in G$: \\
\tab\tab $F = F \union$ (edge CNF described above)
\\\\
\tab return CNF-SATAlgorithm($F$)
\\\\

It must be shown that $F$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ is 3-Colorable.
\\\\
If $G$ is 3-Colorable, then each vertex is one of $\{r, g, b\}$. For each vertex $v_i$ colored $c$, let $c_i$ be true, and the other two colors associated with $i$ to be false in $F$, and this will satisfy $F$.
\\\\
If $F$ is satisfiable, then for all $i$, one of $r_i, g_i, b_i$ is true. Use this to color the vertex $v_i$ and it will give a valid 3-Coloring of $G$.
\\\\
Moreover, it must be shown that the transformation from $G$ to $F$ is polynomial. Since each vertex yields 4 clauses and each edge yields 3 clauses, which are both constant-size, the transformation is still polynomial in the number of vertices and number of edges, $O(n^2)$.
\subsection*{17}
In order to reduce the Vertex Cover problem to the Dominating Set problem, given the graph $G$ and desired cover size $k$, we will construct a graph $G'$ such that $G'$ has a dominating set of size $k$ iff $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$. \\
Let $V$ and $E$ be the set of all vertices and edges in $G$ respectively. We will construct $G'$ as follows: \\
$V' = V + $ a vertex $u$ for each edge in $E$.\\
$E' = E + $ an edge between each $u, v$ such that $v$ is an endpoint of the edge $u$ represents in $G$ + an edge between every $x \in V$ that does not already have an edge in $E$.\\\\
To prove that $G'$ has a dominating set of size $k$ iff $G$ has a vertex cover of size $k$ we must prove the relationship in both directions: \\
First, assume $G$ has a vertex cover $VC$ of size $k$. Then $G'$ has a dominating set $DS = VC$ of size $k$ as every vertex $v \in VC$ has a representative vertex $u$ in $G'$ that is connected to every other vertex in $G'$ representing a vertex in $G$ and every vertex in $G'$ representing an edge in $G$ must connected to at least one vertex in $VC$ because at least one of that edge's endpoints in $G$ must be a vertex in $VC$ by the definition of a vertex cover. \\\\
Second, assume $G'$ has a dominating set $DS$ of size $k$. If $DS$ contains any vertices representing an edge in $G$, replace it with one of the vertices representing an endpoint of its edge in $G$. $DS$ is still a dominating set because any edge-representing vertex removed is next to its replacement (one of its endpoints) and every vertex that was next to the removed vertex is also next to its replacement (every endpoint is connected to every other endpoint by our construction). By definition, the vertices of $G'$ are all either in $DS$ or are connected by an edge to a vertex in $DS$. We can therefore construct a vertex cover $VC$ of $G$ by taking every vertex in $G$ that is a vertex represented by a vertex in $DS$ i.e. $VC = DS$. $VC$ must be a vertex cover of $G$ as for any edge in $G$ there must be a vertex in $DS$ that is connected to the vertex representing that edge in $G'$ by the definition of a dominating set. Because $VC = DS$, that vertex is one of the endpoints of that edge in $G$ and is in $VC$.
