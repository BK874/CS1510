\subsection*{a}
The idea is to reduce Clique to an instance of Clique with a fixed $k$, specifically where $k=3n/4$. Call this new problem $3n/4Clique$. Obviously, if the $k$ for Clique already equals $3n/4$, no transformation needs to be made, and the output of $3n/4Clique$ would equal the output of $Clique$. \\
In the case where $k$ is greater than $3n/4$, we can construct $G'$ as input to  $3n/4Clique$ by adding vertices to $G$, such that all the added vertices have no edges connecting them to any other vertices, until $3n/4 = k$. These new vertices will obviously not contribute to any cliques existing in $G$, as they have no connections. 
Now, if $3n/4Clique$ returns true for $G'$, we know that there must be a clique of size $k$ in $G$, as $G'$ maintains all the cliques from $G$, with some added disconnected vertices to ensure that $k=3n/4$. IE it could not be the case that $G'$ has a clique of size $3n/4$ while $G$ does not have a clique of size $k$, as those $3n/4 -k$ vertices that were added could not contribute to any cliques. This transformation certainly takes polynomial time, as it simply requires adding a constant number of disconnected vertices.\\
In the case where $k$ is less than $3n/4$, we can construct $G'$ by adding cliques of size $(3n/4) - k$ to every vertex $V$, where each vertex in the new added clique connects to $V$, as well as all neighbor vertices to $V$ in $G$. Now, any vertex in $G$ that previously belonged to a clique of size $i$ belongs to a clique of size $i + (3n/4) - k$. Thus, if a clique of size $k$ exists in $G$, a clique of size $(3n/4) - k + k = 3n/4$ exists in $G'$. Further, if no clique of size $k$ exists in $G$, there won't be a clique of size $3n/4$ in $G'$, as none of the newly added cliques are connected to each other, and only add $(3n/4) - k$ to each already existing clique in $G$. This transformation will take polynomial time in the input, as we will need to add $n$ new cliques to the graph, each of constant size, and need to make at most $n$ new connections for each added clique (must connect to each vertices neighbors, vertices can have at most $n-1$ neighbors).

A 3-COLOR algorithm makes a choice at every vertex $v_i$ either to color it red, green, or blue. We can model that in a Boolean formula as three variables $r_i$, $g_i$, $b_i$, such that only one of the three can be true. So in the formula $F$ there is a clause $(r_i \oplus g_i \oplus b_i)$, which in CNF is:
\begin{align*}
(\neg r_i \lor \neg g_i) &\land \\
(\neg g_i \lor \neg b_i) &\land \\
(\neg b_i \lor \neg r_i) &\land \\
(r_i \lor g_i \lor b_i) 
\end{align*}
Moreover, for each edge $(v_i, v_j) \in G$, it cannot be the case that they are the same color, which corresponds to the variables $r_i$ and $r_j$ not both being true, same with $g_i$ and $g_j$, and $b_i$ and $b_j$. So in the formula $F$ there is a clause $(\neg (r_i \land r_j)) \land \neg (g_i \land g_j) \land \neg (b_i \land b_j))$, which in CNF is:

\begin{align*}
(\neg r_i \lor \neg r_j) &\land \\
(\neg g_i \lor \neg g_j) &\land \\
(\neg b_i \lor \neg b_j)
\end{align*}

So an algorithm for 3-COLOR is:\\
3-COLORAlgorithm($G$):\\
\tab Let $F = \emptyset$ \\
\tab for each vertex $v_i \in G$: \\
\tab\tab $F = F \union$ (vertex CNF described above)
\\\\
\tab for each edge $(v_i, v_j) \in G$: \\
\tab\tab $F = F \union$ (edge CNF described above)
\\\\
\tab return CNF-SATAlgorithm($F$)
\\\\

It must be shown that $F$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ is 3-Colorable.
\\\\
If $G$ is 3-Colorable, then each vertex is one of $\{r, g, b\}$. For each vertex $v_i$ colored $c$, let $c_i$ be true, and the other two colors associated with $i$ to be false in $F$, and this will satisfy $F$.
\\\\
If $F$ is satisfiable, then for all $i$, one of $r_i, g_i, b_i$ is true. Use this to color the vertex $v_i$ and it will give a valid 3-Coloring of $G$.
\\\\
Moreover, it must be shown that the transformation from $G$ to $F$ is polynomial. Since each vertex yields 4 clauses and each edge yields 3 clauses, which are both constant-size, the transformation is still polynomial in the number of vertices and number of edges, $O(n^2)$.
