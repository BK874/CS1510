The decision tree for this problem can be constructed with the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nodes in the tree have $n$ children, where the $i'th$ child for $1<=i<=n$ corresponds to choosing $v_i$ to be a center point. Thus, the tree has height $k$ and will contain all solutions at the leaves.  
\item The nodes will store the current aggregate distance, that is, the sum of all the distances from each $v\in V$ to its closest center point $c\in C$. 
\end{itemize}
The total size of the tree is $n^k$. This can then be pruned with the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a node at depth $i$ already exists in $C$, prune it. That is, if that vertex has already been added to $C$, remove that sub tree, as a valid solution contains $k$ different vertices in $C$. 
\item If two nodes $u$ and $v$ at depth $i$ have the same $c_1...c_{i-1}$ center points, and $D_u < D_v$, prune $v$ (where $D_u$ is the total aggregate distance for $u$). 
\end {enumerate}
The first pruning rule leaves the tree as still roughly $n^k$. However, under the second pruning rule, every depth $i$ is limited to $n$ nodes. This is because at depth $i-1$, for some node $v$, all of $v's$ children have have the same $c_1...c_{i-1}$, and only one will not be pruned, that is the one with the shortest $D$. This brings the size of the tree down to $nk$.
